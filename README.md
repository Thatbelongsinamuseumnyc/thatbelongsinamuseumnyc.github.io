## Adding collections

2/12/2016

* add audio files to the `audio/` directory with the naming convention collection#item# or ex. c1i1.mp3 for short
* [convert mp3 audio file](http://www.online-convert.com) to ogg (for firefox), make sure to have both versions for cross-browser support
* add images to the `img/` directory in the collection folder (`c1/` for collection 1 for example); name images according to their object name (c1/bracelet.jpg)
* look for "Item" comments in the collection-1.html page, copy and duplicate for additional items
* to make a new collection copy the contents of collection-1.html and replace irrelevant item data with new items


### Changes
* 2/12 - changed the cbpAnimatedHeader.js for the collections header so the scroll heading delay appropriately matches the collection pages
